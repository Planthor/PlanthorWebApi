# Domain Layer

The Domain Layer contains the core business logic and entities of the application. It encapsulates the fundamental concepts and rules of the domain.

## Entities

Contains the domain entities representing essential objects within the domain.

## Value Objects

Contains immutable objects representing attributes with no conceptual identity, typically embedded within entities.

## Services

Contains domain services responsible for encapsulating business logic that doesn't naturally fit within entities.
